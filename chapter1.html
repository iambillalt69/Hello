        <h1>Chapter 1: Appologies</h1>
        <p>Happy belated Valentines btw. I just want to sincerely apologize for the way I’ve been acting lately.<br>I know I’ve been distant, bohot zyada rude, aur mere shitty ego ko beech me laa diya, and I deeply regret it. Due to some recent "incidents" i've realised ki kitna wrong tha mai for treating you this badly. You mean so much to me, and I hate that I made you feel unappreciated. I failed to see your real value, and that’s completely on me. You’ve always been there for me, and instead of treating you with the love and respect you deserve, I pushed you away. I’m truly sorry for hurting you, and I want you to know that never in my wildest dreams i thought of betraying you or lying to you. (hidden letter is H) This year i didn't even gift you anything for valentines or new year or took you anywhere for a chicken date. I've apologized and repeated the same mistakes again and again so many times that i've lost your trust at this point and it hurts everyday when i see you pushing me away and vice versa. You are an incredible person but i let my mistakes ruin our bond.</p>
